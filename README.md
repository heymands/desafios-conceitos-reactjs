# APP REPOSITORIES
This was a good challenge, where I can applied what i've learned with the first module of Bootcamp GoStack. In this module, I learned more about ReactJS, Babel and Webpack, loaders and plugins. 
How to configure them to use with the frontend who is connected with the api. This app list the repositories, create a new repo and deleted then, all that showing in the screen.

## About ✏️
In this project, I connected the application with the API, and directly with the backend, I was able to list the repositories, delete them and show them on screen. Challenge developed for the GoStack Bootcamp for personal study.
